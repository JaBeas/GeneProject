              The instructions to the computer how the analysis is going to be
              performed are specified using the Python programming language. The
              forthcoming examples are simple illustrations of the type of
              problem settings and corresponding Python implementations that are
              encountered in bioinformatics.

              However, the leading Python software for bioinformatics
              applications is BioPython and for real-world problem solving one
              should rather utilize BioPython instead of home-made solutions.
              The aim of the sections below is to illustrate the nature of
              bioinformatics analysis and introduce what is inside packages like
              BioPython.

              We shall start with some very simple examples on DNA analysis that
              bring together basic building blocks in programming: loops, if
              tests, and functions. As reader you should be somewhat familiar
              with these building blocks in general and also know about the
              specific Python syntax.

              {`def count_v2(dna, base):
    i = 0 # counter
    for c in dna:
        if c == base:
            i += 1
    return i

dna = 'ATGCGGACCTAT'
base = 'C'
n = count_v2(dna, base)

# printf-style formatting
print '%s appears %d times in %s' % (base, n, dna)

# or (new) format string syntax
print '{base} appears {n} times in {dna}'.format(
    base=base, n=n, dna=dna)`}
